# Skills!

Music iOS application on JavaScript which I started to develop in june 2014 so now code looks quite old. For one year this app and Swayer Super Sampler were downloaded around 20k times!

## About 
Firstly, Skills is the best beat maker and the peachiest pad tracker you have ever. Why so? 

a. Skills looks snazzy and sharp.

b. Zillion of presets literally. (there is a super shuffle machine that mix together a huge quantity of samples and compartmentalize them smart.) 

c. An enormous mass of the most realistic samples.
Secondly, with Skills you can only depend on your skills and ability to make your beat sounds smooth and catchy.
